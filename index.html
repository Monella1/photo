        <p>The Session at photo book was amazing. We have done three <br>family sessions with Emily and could not be more pleased with <br>how the sessions went and her photos turned out. I have two <br>wild young boys who don't always love family photo sessions. <br>But with photobook, they have a great time and she captures <br> what seem like impossible photo with how much they move <br> around. Thanks Emily!</p>
